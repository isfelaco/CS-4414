partner 2: Michelle Nguyen, mtn7vez@virginia.edu

We met on Zoom and worked through the harness file together, debugging reading input.
Bella did the list_insert_tail and list_remove_head while Michelle worked on list_visit_items and our helper function in the harness file, list_print_item.
Michelle also wrote the Makefile.
